## What is the purpose of this shiny app?

The T distribution calculator makes it easy to compute T scores based on cumulative probabilities.You only need the degrees of freedom and Cumulative probability and you can get the T scores instantly.

## How to use this shiny app?

For how to use the calculator,please follow the instructions below.

1.Enter the shiny app website: https://kannhaku.shinyapps.io/Coursera_data/

2.Enter a value for degrees of freedom.

3.Enter the Cumulative probability: P(T < t)

4.Click the Calculate button to compute a value for the T score

## The algorithm behind this shiny app.

I use the "qt" funtion in the stats package to compute the T score.

Usage:
qt(p, df, ncp, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)

p : vector of probabilities.

df: degrees of freedom (> 0, maybe non-integer). df = Inf is allowed.

ncp: non-centrality parameter delta; currently except for rt(), only for abs(ncp) <= 37.62. If omitted, use the central t distribution.

log, log.p	logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).

lower.tail	logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are P[X < x], otherwise, P[X > x].

--- .

## An example of the shiny app.

If I enter the freedom 5 and Cumulative probability is 0.975.

```r
library(stats)
qt(0.975, 5)
```

```
## [1] 2.571
```


then I will get the T score is 2.570582.
